# RepeatedString

Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.

Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single string, s. 
The second line contains an integer, n.

## Constraints

1 <= |s| <= 100

1 <= n <= 10^12

For 25% of the test cases, n <= 10^6.

## Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the number of letter a's in the first n letters of the infinite string created by repeating s infinitely many times.

## Sample Input 0

aba
10

## Sample Output 0

7

## Explanation 0 
The first n = 10 letters of the infinite string are abaabaabaa. Because there are 7 a's, we print 7 on a new line.
